## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories to separate different types of coursework:

-   **`üìÅ Exam Preparation`**: Contains a mix of C code (`.c`) and text files (`.txt`) used for studying and preparing for semester examinations. This includes practice problems, important concepts, and quick reference notes.

-   **`üìÅ Practical File`**: This directory holds the organized, topic-wise practical assignments completed as part of the lab curriculum. It is further divided into sub-folders based on the programming concept.

-   **`üìÅ Practical Preparation`**: Includes a series of C programs written to practice for practical lab exams and viva sessions. The files are numbered sequentially for easy tracking.

## üß† Topics Covered

The code within the `Practical File` directory covers fundamental concepts in the C programming language, including:

-   **Arrays**: Programs demonstrating array manipulation, searching, sorting, and multi-dimensional arrays.
-   **Pointers**: Exercises on pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, and using pointers with arrays and functions.
-   **Strings**: A comprehensive set of programs for string handling, manipulation, and standard library functions.
-   **Structures**: Code examples showing how to define and use structures to manage complex data types.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To compile and run any of the C programs in this repository, you will need a C compiler like **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** installed on your system.

### How to Compile and Run

1.  **Navigate to a file's directory:**
    Open your terminal and navigate to the folder containing the C file you want to run.

    ```bash
    cd "Practical File/1 - Array"
    ```

2.  **Compile the C file:**
    Use the `gcc` command to compile the source code into an executable file.

    ```bash
    # Example for the file '1_array.c'
    gcc 1_array.c -o 1_array_executable
    ```

    This command creates an executable file named `1_array_executable`.

3.  **Run the executable:**
    Execute the compiled program from your terminal.
    ```bash
    ./1_array_executable
    ```
